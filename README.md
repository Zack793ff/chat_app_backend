# FastAPI Backend for AI Chat App

This project contains the FastAPI backend service for an AI chat application. The backend is responsible for processing user messages, generating AI responses, and facilitating communication with the Flutter frontend.

## Features

- FastAPI-based web server for handling HTTP requests from the frontend.
- Integration with AI services for generating intelligent responses.
- Secure communication using HTTPS and token-based authentication.
- Scalable architecture for handling multiple concurrent connections.

## Technologies Used

- FastAPI: Fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- Python: Programming language used for backend development.
- AI Services: Integration with AI services for generating responses.
- Pydantic: Data validation and serialization library used with FastAPI.

## Usage

- Once the backend is running, it will start listening for incoming requests.
- The frontend application sends user messages to the backend using HTTP requests.
- The backend processes the messages, generates AI responses, and returns them to the frontend.
- Monitor the backend logs for debugging and performance optimization.
